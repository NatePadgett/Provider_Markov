Don’t delay
Far from the land unknown
With only hope of the land unknown
Onward for the golden age
Winter came and I was old and and I cried for the ground were drawn upon the golden age
I wouldn’t delay
Follow me down a fox hole in the golden age
Provider, carry on
Gathered round
Don’t delay
Come morning, miles alone
Winter came and I cried for the ground
When the man’s ago
Provider, carry on
Joy to gain
