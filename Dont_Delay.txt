I wouldn’t delay
Far from the ground, those remained
Come morning, miles alone
With bird in hand and I cried for the man’s curse
When the ground were drawn upon the ground
Come morning, miles alone
I wouldn’t delay
Gathered round, those remained
Come morning, miles alone
With onto a land
Come morning, miles along
Gathered round
Follow me down a fox hole in the golden age
Onward for the sea’s gone under the land
Gathered round, those remained
