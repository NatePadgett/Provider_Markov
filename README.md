**OVERVIEW**

[Midlake](https://www.facebook.com/midlakeband/) is one of my favorite bands and their fourth album [Antiphon](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18696-midlake-antiphon/) is generally on repeat two weeks out of a given month. The second song on that album, "Provider", has always struck me as incredibly beautiful, particularly lyrically, so I wanted to use it as my source for this assignment. 

With Provider_Markov, I experimented with Markov chains
